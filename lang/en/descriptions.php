<ul>
<li>More than five months before: Everything is refundable!</li>
<li>Less than five months before: 75% of the trip cost is refundable, except for the non-refundable €30 booking fee. There is no charge to change the trip destination or start date.</li>
<li>Less than four months before: 50% of the trip cost is refundable, except for the non-refundable €30 booking fee. A €100 fee applies to change the trip destination or start date.</li>

</ul>
<p>If the balance has not been paid in full, the above percentages apply to all money paid as of the cancellation date.  
Transfers will incur the applicable fee to change trips. Additionally, your refund policy level will carry over to your new trip (e.g., for transfers made less than three months before the trip, the new trip cost will still be 25% refundable, regardless of the new date).</p>  
<p>NOTE: Participants who have purchased trip cancellation insurance will be refunded by the insurance company up until the program departure date.</p>',
